1.WAP to input 2 numbers and check whether the first is divisible by the second and print true or false depending on the divisibility. 

  sol:
      n1 = int(input("enter the number"))
      n2 = int(input("enter the number"))
      if n1%n2 == 0:
          print('{0} is divisible by the {1}'.format(n1,n2))
      else:
          print('{0} is  not divisible by the {1}'.format(n1,n2))


2. In the palindrome example, make the code case insensitive.i.e. Naman should also be treated as a palindrome (HINT: first convert to either upper or plower case). 
 
   sol:
       s = input("enter the string")
       s = s.upper()
       p = s[::-1]
       print(p)

6.WAP to input year (check if user enters valid year. Should be 4-digit number and should not be negative) and print whether leap year or not. (If really interested in why you also have to check the divisibility by 400 just google the exact time it takes for the earth to revolve around the sub) 
 
  sol:
      n = int(input("enter the number:"))
      if n >=1000 and n<=9999:
           if n%400 == 0 and n%4 == 0:

7.WAP to input a string and convert it to Upper Case if number of characters is odd and convert to lower case otherwise.

  sol:
      n = input("enter the string:")
      s = len(n)

         print(n.lower())
      else:
         print(n.upper())

8. WAP to input a string and print Veg if the string doesn’t contain the word egg. Otherwise print Non-Veg. As usual eggs can be both big and small.

             print("given number divisible by both 5 and 7")
        else:
